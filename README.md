# VNIT-12

* The .json file is converted to CSV using a python code where we read the input from .json file. This acts as our sub-module 1 for reading the input. Panda library is used for this conversion.

* For the OHLC engine we used plotty to plot the candles according to the data to be taken from user.

* For UI we were initially trying to use an HTML CSS based webpage to take as input from the client for their queries but then we used interactive python notebook as a UI to connect to the repository.
